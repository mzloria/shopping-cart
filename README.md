# shopping-cart
Shopping cart program.

This is a shopping cart program that displays a GUI and adjusts the current price
based on the selections of the user. I created the backend code of this program.
The user can input different quantities of each item and the program will properly
calculate the new total. 

Frontend of the program was created by Alan Fowler.
